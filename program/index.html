  <meta property="og:description" content="ðŸš§ (To be refined soon) The ANSyA workshop is intended as a forum for researchers and practitioners to present and discuss their work on practical applications of NeSy. For this reason, the workshop is designed to incentivize the circulation of ideas and the discussion of results.
The workshop will consist of a single half day of activities, including one keynote speech, and poster session.
While keynote speeches will be delivered by prominent figures in the NeSy community (preferably one from academia and one from industry), the poster sessions will be organized to allow authors to present their work to the audience. In particular, each poster shall correspond to one paper accepted for presentation by the program committee. Keynotes will address relevant open issues as well as key challenges affecting the development or deployment of NeSy in real-world scenarios. Moreover, we aim for keynote speakers to provide insights on the recent trends in NeSy engineering and future research directions. On the other hand, the preference for poster sessions over traditional paper presentations is motivated by the desire to foster discussion and interaction among participants.">
