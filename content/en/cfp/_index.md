__Authors are invited to submit original papers in PDF format to the [submission website](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=lostan2025).__

## üìÉ Submission Type

The workshop provides a platform to share experimental and theoretical results, present artefacts, demos and datasets, as well as broad discussion or survey papers. Therefore, LoStaN invites researchers and practitioners to submit the following types of contribution:

1. __Full__ or __short__ papers about NeSy approaches, emphasising practical aspects, applications, or applicability to real-world problems. Full papers should be limited to __14 pages__, while short papers should be limited to __7 pages__ _(excluding references)_.

2. __Position papers__ concerning NeSy applications in specific fields. Position papers should be limited to __7 pages__ _(excluding references)_.

3. __Survey papers__, concerning any of the above. Survey papers should be limited to __14 pages__ _(excluding references)_.

‚ùó Preliminary or already-published work can be submitted, provided that the submission is clearly marked as such. ‚ùó 

## üìã Submission Guidelines

- Submissions should be in [__standard Springer LNCS style__]( https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines);
- Submissions must be exported in __PDF format__;
- _Camera-ready_ versions shall include the LaTeX __source files__;
- Submissions are not anonymous.


## üî¨ Topics of Interest

Given the broad categorization of NeSy AI systems, we welcome papers that propose applications and engineering research in various domains, including (but not limited to):

- Neuro-Symbolic integration application in cybersecurity
- Neuro-Symbolic integration and intelligent agents
- Neuro-Symbolic integration and intelligent networked systems
- Neuro-Symbolic integration application in healthcare
- Neuro-Symbolic integration and large language models
- Neuro-Symbolic integration application in robotics
- Neuro-Symbolic integration application in computer vision
- Neuro-Symbolic integration for planning
- Neuro-Symbolic integration for programming (e.g., program synthesis)
- Symbolic knowledge extraction (SKE) or injection (SKI)
- Theorem proving via Neuro-Symbolic integration
- Automated reasoning via Neuro-Symbolic integration
- AI trustworthiness (explainable, fair, etc.) via Neuro-Symbolic integration
- Symbolic regression via Neuro-Symbolic integration
- Inductive logic programming via Neuro-Symbolic integration

__Twin communities:__ We also welcome contributions from twin communities leveraging different nomenclature for similar concepts, such as informed-machine learning, symbolic knowledge extraction or injection, etc.


## üìù Reviewing Format

LoStaN follows a 2-phase reviewing process:
1. Each submission will undergo a traditional double-blind review process. This phase applies to all papers, regardless of type, and will determine the final acceptance or rejection decision. 
2. The second phase occurs during and after the workshop: accepted contributions are presented (as posters) at the workshop, and authors may collect further comments and insights. After that, authors who are willing to publish their contribution to the workshop proceedings will be requested to produce a final version of the paper, addressing the reviewers‚Äô suggestions and possibly integrating comments and insights from the workshop.

All papers will undergo the standard assessment in which reviewers will be asked to consider the submission focusing on its:
- __scope__: is the paper on-topic w.r.t. the workshop‚Äôs track or theme?
- __significance__: is the idea proposed in the paper meaningful for the NeSy community? Are the results relevant?
- __soundness__: is the approach proposed in the paper correct and robust? Are experiments (if any) well-designed?
- __clarity__: is the paper clear and well organized? Is the discussion complete?
- __contextualization__: is relevant background and related literature being adequately referenced?
- __novelty__: is the contribution novel either from a conceptual or technical perspective?
- __practical__ applicability: is the proposed idea applicable in practice? Can it scale? Do the authors provide convincing evidence?

Furthermore, the reviews will take into account the specific characteristics of the submitted contributions to obtain their final decision. For example, submissions proposing novel software will receive a score depending also on the quality of the shared software. Similarly, demo papers will receive a score depending on the usability and utility of the tool under demonstration.

## üìñ Proceedings 

The workshop will publish its own proceedings onto Scopus-indexed repositories, such as [CEUR-WS](https://ceur-ws.org/).

‚ùó __Important note:__ Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings __only if__ the authors explicitly agree to do so. 
In this way, works which are not mature enough for publication, as well as works which have already been published elsewhere can be presented and discussed at the workshop.
