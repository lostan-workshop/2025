## Submission Types

We invite the following types of contribution:

1. __full__ or __short__ papers about NeSy theoretical findings, approaches, applications, or applicability to real-world problems;
    + page limit: __14__ pages for full papers, __7__ pages for short papers (excluding references);

2. __position papers__ concerning NeSy applications in specific fields;
    + page limit: __7__ pages (excluding references);

3. __survey papers__, concerning any of the above.
    + page limit: __14__ pages (excluding references).

__TBD__: we will also consider other types of contributions.

Preliminary or already-published work can be submitted, provided that the submission is clearly marked as such.

## Relevant topics

__TBD__

LoStaN focuses on the practical application of NeSy into any possible field. 

Leveraging on the seminal work by Sarker et al., 
we consider as NeSy any system falling into one (or more) of the following categories:

- neural-based processing systems where input and output are presented in a symbolic form;

- neural-based processing systems that compile symbolic rules during training;

- systems such as Neuro-Symbolic Concept-Learner representing a cascading from neural systems to symbolic reasoners;

- systems such as AlphaGo and AlphaZero where neural pattern recognition subroutines are used within a symbolic problem solver;

- bidirectional framework in which neural and symbolic components communicate, such as DeepProblog and NeurASP;

- systems that embed symbolic reasoning inside a neural engine.

### Twin communities

We also welcome contributions from twin communities leveraging different nomenclature for similar concepts, such as informed-machine learning, symbolic knowledge extraction or injection, etc.

### Keywords

Given the broad categorization of NeSy AI systems, we welcome papers that propose applications and engineering research in various domains, including (but not limited to):

- NeSy and cybersecurity

- NeSy and intelligent agents

- NeSy and intelligent networked systems

- NeSy in healthcare

- NeSy and large language models

- NeSy in robotics

- NeSy in computer vision

- NeSy for planning

- NeSy for programming (e.g., program synthesis)

- Symbolic knowledge extraction or injection

- Theorem proving via NeSy

- Automated reasoning via NeSy

- AI trustworthiness (explainable, fair, etc.) via NeSy

- Symbolic regression via NeSy

- Inductive logic programming via NeSy

## Submission Guidelines


- Submissions should be in [__standard Springer LNCS style__]( https://www.springer.com/gp/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines);

- Submissions must be exported in __PDF format__;

- _Camera-ready_ versions shall include the LaTeX __source files__;

- Submissions are not anonymous.

## Reviewing Format

We consider a 2-phase reviewing process:

1. Each submission will undergo a traditional double-blind review process. This phase applies to all papers, regardless of type, and will determine the final acceptance or rejection decision. 

2. The second phase occurs during and after the workshop: accepted contributions are presented (as posters) at the workshop, and authors may collect further comments and insights. 

After that, authors who are willing to publish their contribution to the workshop proceedings will be requested to produce a final version of the paper, addressing the reviewers’ suggestions and possibly integrating comments and insights from the workshop.

All papers will undergo the standard assessment in which reviewers will be asked to consider the submission focusing on its:

- __scope__: is the paper on-topic w.r.t. the workshop’s track or theme?

- __significance__: is the idea proposed in the paper meaningful for the NeSy community? Are the results relevant?

- __soundness__: is the approach proposed in the paper correct and robust? Are experiments (if any) well-designed?

- __clarity__: is the paper clear and well organized? Is the discussion complete?

- __contextualization__: is relevant background and related literature being adequately referenced?

- __novelty__: is the contribution novel either from a conceptual or technical perspective?


Furthermore, the reviews will take into account the specific characteristics of the submitted contributions to obtain their final decision. 
For example, submissions proposing novel software will receive a score depending also on the quality of the shared software. 
Similarly, demo papers will receive a score depending on the usability and utility of the tool under demonstration.

## Proceedings 

The workshop will publish its own proceedings onto Scopus-indexed repositories, such as [CEUR-WS](https://ceur-ws.org/).

> Accepted papers will be included in the workshop proceedings __only if__ the authors explicitly agree to do so. 
In this way, works which are not mature enough for publication, as well as works which have already been published elsewhere can be presented and discussed at the workshop.
